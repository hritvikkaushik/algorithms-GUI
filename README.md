# algorithms-GUI
This is my first exercise in implementing a simple GUI.

The programs for this assignment have been written in Python (ver 3.8.2). The library
‘Tkinter’, which is part of the Python Standard Library, has been used to write the user
interface for all the programs. Thus, Python must be installed on the computer to execute
these scripts, and all these scripts must be present in the same directory.

The main window is to be started by running the script ‘Main_GUI.py’ and from there the
user selects which algorithm is to be executed. Then the UI for that algorithm is started in a
separate window. Instructions as to how to provide input to the UI have been provided in the
UI itself, wherever necessary.

## Algorithms
The project, at this stage, implements the following algorithms:
* Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
* Huffman Coding
* Activity Selection
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Fractional Knapsack
